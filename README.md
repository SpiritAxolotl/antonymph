This is just a mirror of the code for the sake of archival, check out the live version at [lyra.horse/antonymph/](https://lyra.horse/antonymph/) (or watch the [YouTube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGMaINyM0ek)).

The code is written by me, but some of the resources belong to other authors and artists, please check the outro of the experience or YouTube description for epic credits.
